# Agentic AI Personal Assistant

An intelligent personal assistant built with Langchain that learns your preferences, manages your tasks, provides contextual reminders, and integrates with your calendar.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive personal AI assistant that:
- Learns work habits, communication style, preferences (food, music, products) through conversations
- Manages todo lists and shopping lists with natural language input
- Provides intelligent reminders for work deadlines, health, water intake, and errands
- Maintains conversation context and personal preferences across sessions
- Integrates with Google Calendar (read/write) for scheduling and meeting preparation
- Offers a modern, responsive web interface built with Next.js
- Deploys on AWS with a simple but scalable architecture

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **AI Agent**: Langchain-powered conversational agent
- **Memory System**: Long-term storage of preferences and context
- **Task Manager**: Todo and shopping list management
- **Reminder Engine**: Intelligent notification system
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar/Outlook integration
- **Web Interface**: Modern React-based UI
- **API Backend**: FastAPI/Flask REST API

### Tech Stack

#### **Phase 1: Traditional Architecture (MVP)**
- **Backend**: Python, Langchain, FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (production)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4, Langchain agents with direct tool integration
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API (direct integration)
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker

#### **Phase 2: MCP Migration (Future Enhancement)**
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized AI-service integration
- **Architecture**: Three-tier (AI Client ↔ MCP Server ↔ Resources)
- **Benefits**: Enhanced security, tool composability, third-party integrations
- **Migration**: Gradual refactoring of direct integrations to MCP resources/tools

**Status**: 🚀 Building MVP - Phase 1 in Progress
**Last Updated**: January 2025

## 🎯 MVP Focus
1. **Conversational AI** with OpenAI GPT-4 and memory persistence
2. **Task Management** for todos and shopping lists
3. **Google Calendar Integration** for event management
4. **Modern Web Interface** with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS
5. **Simple Reminder System** for key activities

## 🔄 MCP Migration Strategy

### **Why MCP Later?**
We're building with traditional Langchain first, then migrating to **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for enhanced standardization and security.

#### **Current Approach (Phase 1)**
```python
# Direct integrations - fast development
calendar_service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)
agent = create_langchain_agent(tools=[calendar_tool, task_tool])
```

#### **Future MCP Approach (Phase 10)**
```python
# Standardized protocol - enhanced security & composability
mcp_server = PersonalAssistantMCPServer()
mcp_server.register_resource("calendar://events")
mcp_server.register_tool("create_task")
```

### **MCP Benefits We'll Gain**
- 🔐 **Enhanced Security**: Fine-grained permissions per resource
- 🔧 **Tool Composability**: AI can chain multiple services automatically  
- 🌐 **Third-party Integration**: Open protocol for external developers
- 📊 **Standardized Interface**: Uniform way to access all services
- 🚀 **Scalability**: Better architecture for multiple AI clients

### **Migration Path**
1. **Build working MVP** with direct integrations
2. **Identify integration patterns** from real usage
3. **Design MCP resource/tool abstractions** 
4. **Gradual migration** service by service
5. **Enhanced features** possible only with MCP
